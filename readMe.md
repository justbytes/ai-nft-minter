# NFT Genie

NFT Genie is a DApp that gives users the ability to create NFTs in minutes. This is done by using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator to create images. Those images are then uploaded to IPFS via NFT.Storage and minted on the Ethereum blockchain. After an image is minted you can view the NFT on OpenSea and list it for sale.
