# NFT Genie

## Overview

NFT Genie is a DApp that gives users the ability to create NFTs in minutes. This is done by using the Stable Diffusion text-to-image generator to create images. Those images are then uploaded to IPFS via NFT.Storage and minted using the Ethereum blockchain. After an image is minted you can view the NFT on OpenSea and list it for sale.

## How it works

1. Connect Metamask via MetaMask browser extension.

2. Configure your MetaMask wallet to use the Goerli Testnet and get WETH from a faucet.

3. Connect your Metamask wallet by clicking the connect button in the top right corner.

4. Enter a prompt in the prompt field and prompt till you get a picture you like.

5. Give the image a Name, Description, and up to six attributes.

6. Click mint image which will then open MetaMask, sign the transaction and pay the gas fees.

7. Go to OpeanSea, connect your MetaMask wallet, click profile and view your NFT.

## Smart Contract Address

Currently NFT Genie is deployed to the Goerli Testnet address: 0x5A5fE2Dda9A68aEc28F4204AdE54f245106d0e11.
